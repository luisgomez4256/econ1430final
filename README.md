Hello! In this GitHub you will find:

1. seda_admindist_CA.dta
This dta file contains the test score data for individual school districts over time. This data was downloaded from the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.

3. Neighborhood_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month
This csv file contains a cleaned up record of housing prices in Silicon Valley over time. This data was downloaded from Zillow.

4. Admin
This do file contains the commands I gave Stata to help me arrive at my findings, and to generate the graph and tables.





Thank you so much!
